# Reusable Embeddings

Labeled data for our classification models is expensive and precious. Here we will address how we can reuse pre-trained embeddings to make our models with TensorFlow Hub.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how transfer learning applies to natural language
- Construct word embeddings using GloVe and Word2Vec
- Make use of pre-trained embeddings on TensorFlow Hub
- Make your Hub embeddings trainable

## Learning Objectives

- Review sequence-to-sequence models
- Analyze the structure of an encoder-decoder network
- Overcome limitations of traditional encoder-decoder networks with Beam Search
- -mproving language translation with attention networks
