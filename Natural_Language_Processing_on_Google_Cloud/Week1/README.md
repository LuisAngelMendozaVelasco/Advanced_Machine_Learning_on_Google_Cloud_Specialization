# Working with Sequences

In this module, youâ€™ll learn what a sequence is, see how you can prepare sequence data for modeling, and be introduced to some classical approaches to sequence modeling and practice applying them.

## Learning Objectives

- Define what a sequence is
- Prepare sequence data for modeling
- Apply classical approaches to sequence modeling using linear models, DNNs and CNNs
