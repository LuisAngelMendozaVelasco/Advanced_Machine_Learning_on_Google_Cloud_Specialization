# Architecting Production ML Systems

This module explores what else a production ML system needs to do and how to meet those needs. You review how to make important, high-level, design decisions around training and model serving need to make in order to get the right performance profile for your model.

## Learning Objectives

- Choose the appropriate paradigm for training and serving
- Evaluate each component of a production ML system's architecture
- Deploy an ML architecture
- Describe the benefits of using Vertex AI
