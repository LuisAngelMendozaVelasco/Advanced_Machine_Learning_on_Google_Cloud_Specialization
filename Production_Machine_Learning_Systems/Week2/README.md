# Designing Adaptable ML Systems

In this module, you learn how to recognize the ways that our model is dependent on our data, make cost-conscious engineering decisions, know when to roll back our models to earlier versions, debug the causes of observed model behavior and implement a pipeline that is immune to one type of dependency.

# Learning Objectives

- Describe how upstream data dependencies can affect your model
- Analyze, debug, and adapt common model dependency issues
- Perform TensorFlow data validation
- Investigate and visualize a dataset using TensorFlow Data Validation
- Serve ML predictions in batch and real time
