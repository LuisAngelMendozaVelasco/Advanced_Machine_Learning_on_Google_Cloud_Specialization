# Dealing with Data Scarcity

In this module, we’ll focus on data scarcity, what it is, why it’s important, and, before moving onto building ML models, what you need to do about it.

## Learning Objectives

- Calculate the number of parameters for ML models and understand why the data needs grow with the number of parameters
- Understand how data augmentation can improve performance if done thoughtfully
- Understand how to add data augmentation to a model
- Apply understanding of CNNs to the concept of task dependence
- Understand how transfer learning decreases the need for data
