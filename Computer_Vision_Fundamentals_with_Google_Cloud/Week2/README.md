# Dealing with Data Scarcity

In this module, we’ll focus on data scarcity, what it is, why it’s important, and, before moving onto building ML models, what you need to do about it.

## Learning Objectives

- Calculate the number of parameters for ML models and understand why the data needs grow with the number of parameters
- Understand how data augmentation can improve performance if done thoughtfully
- Understand how to add data augmentation to a model
- Apply understanding of CNNs to the concept of task dependence
- Understand how transfer learning decreases the need for data

# Pre-built ML Models for Image Classification

Welcome to the last module of the Image Classification course. Now that you have build your own image classifiers using linear, DNN, and CNN models with TensorFlow, it’s time to experiment with pre-built image models. In most cases, you will want to try these before investing your time in developing custom TensorFlow code for a model.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between pre-trained and pre-built models
- Create a JSON API request to the pre-trained Cloud Vision API model
- Create, train, and predict with an AutoML model with custom image classification labels
