# Neural Networks for Recommendation Systems

In this module we show how various recommendation systems can be combined as part of a hybrid approach.

## Learning Objectives

- Combine content-based, knowledge-based, and collaborative filtering recommendation systems.
- Use neural networks to make hybrid recommendation systems.
- Describe how context can affect the meaning of user data.
- Identify the types of different context-aware algorithms.
