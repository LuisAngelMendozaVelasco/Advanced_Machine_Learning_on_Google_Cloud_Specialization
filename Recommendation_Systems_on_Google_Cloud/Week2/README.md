# Neural Networks for Recommendation Systems

In this module we show how various recommendation systems can be combined as part of a hybrid approach.

## Learning Objectives

- Combine content-based, knowledge-based, and collaborative filtering recommendation systems.
- Use neural networks to make hybrid recommendation systems.
- Describe how context can affect the meaning of user data.
- Identify the types of different context-aware algorithms.

# Building an End-to-End Recommendation System

In this module we put all the pieces together to build a smart end-to-end workflow for your newly built WALS recommendation model for news articles.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the primary branches along with some useful types of RL (model-based, model-free, value-based, policy-based, and contextual bandits).
- Identify problems that reinforcement learning can help solve.
- Describe the framework and workflow to solve a common reinforcement learning problem.
- Identify use cases where RL is the ideal approach to solving an ML problem over other methods.
